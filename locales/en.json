    "text": "<p>The object of DECRYPTER is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4-6 slots. Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code. You have 8 attempts to decrypt the code.</p><p>Each guess is made by selecting a row of code slots on the code row. Once input, the game provides feedback by displaying from zero to four/six keys in the small slots of the row with the guess. A red key is activated for each code slot from the guess which is correct in both color/type and position. A white key activated indicates the existence of a correct color/type input placed in the wrong position.</p><p>If there are duplicate colours/types in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colours/types in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is white-white-black-black and the player guesses white-white-white-black, the game will award two colored keys for the two correct whites, nothing for the third white as there is not a third white in the code, and a red key for the black. No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second black.</p>",
